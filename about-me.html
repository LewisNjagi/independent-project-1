                <p>I am a former student of 
                    Jomo Kenyatta University Of Agriculture And Technology.
                    Upon the pandemic rising, i was fiinishing my career in 
                    Architectural Technology that's when i decided to join Moringa
                    School to seek knowledge on programming.

                    Growing up in the suburbs of Muranga, i was very pasionate about
                    machine learning i guess you'd call it, before smartphones
                    we're a thing. My first android device was a samsung galaxy s3 and 
                    getting my hands on, i was intrigued by everything about it but especially
                    softwares, which lead me crashing the phone as i tried installing 
                    another 'better' android version on the device.

                    Nowadays i am very passionate about reading books. Knowledge is power
                    indeed, the revelation that lead me to programming.
                    I enjoy playing football but not professionally but as a means of 
                    exercise, keeping my body fit. I am skilled at drawing and i talk a little 
                    french too. I play video games a lot and with the rise of online multiplayer
                    games just arose the child within me.

                    And above all, i am very passionate about Christ, His work at the croos
                    lead me to believe in Him being the son of God. Because the truth of the 
                    matter is, life is spiritual and eternity awaits, the only question is where 
                    will you spend it?
