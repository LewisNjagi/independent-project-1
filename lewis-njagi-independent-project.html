                <p>I am a potential software engineer currently studying at Moringa School.</p>
                <p>I got my place at Moringa school by passion and 
                    it will be maintained by 
                    commitment.

                    As Jesus once said, <span class="word">“No one, after putting his hand 
                    to the plow and looking back, 
                    is fit for the kingdom of God.”</span>

                </p>
                <p>I have worked on some few <a href="pair-twoprogram/my-favourite-things.html"><strong>projects</strong></a></p>
